  <p id="words"> I have often wondered what it is that makes me who I am. Is it my personality, or my character? Is it the way that I dress? Maybe it is my choice of career? Or, maybe it is a combination of all of these things, because I donâ€™t think that there is one description or label that is capable of defining me completely.

I like to think that for the most part, I am a pretty easy person to get along with. I am generally a positive person to be around and I try not to judge anyone for the choices that they make or the beliefs that they subscribe to. I just treat everyone with the same respect that I would like to be treated with. However, this does not mean that I am a pushover. I do not suffer fools gladly and if you try to take advantage of me you are very likely to see a completely different side of me! I think that this is something that is probably true of most people though, so maybe I am fairly typical in that respect.</p>

  </button>  <p id="poem">I am offering this poem to you,
Since I have nothing else to give.
Keep it like the heart
That I will always give to you.

I have nothing else to give you
So I remind you that my love
Is too much to contain. My
Love is a sweater ready to
Warm you on a cold day or a 
Winter night.

I love you and only you.
You are my greatest inspiration.
  I love you to the moon and back.</p>
